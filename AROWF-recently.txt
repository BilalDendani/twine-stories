[[ **Click for more pronunciation evaluation.** ->PronEval]]

[[ **Use my memory of the event for the date it occurred.** ->End 2]]

[[ **Go through my old newspapers to find the particular event.**->End 3]]

[[ **Search for an online source that refers to the particular event. **->Step 2]]

It's better to do a more detailed edit of the article.

[[**Go back..** ->Start]]

:: Step 2
Which online source would be the most reliable for you?
[[**An online blogger who has talked about this event in detail.**->End 4]]

[[**My online friends on Facebook give reliable information.** ->End 5]]

[[**Replace the word "recently" with the date and touch nothing else .** ->End 6]]

[[**Replace the word "recently" with the date and cite the source used.** ->Step 4]]

[[**Cite the source that can be used and let someone else replace "recently".** ->End 7]]

Although this is a reasonable source, it is better if the source is more reliable and has a good track record.
[[**Go back.** ->Step 2]]

Wikipedia articles should always be reliable, published sources. Facebook is not the way.

[[**Go back.** ->Step 3]]

:: End 6
Its always best to cite the sources used so that someone else can verify what you've edited more easily.

[[**Go back.** ->Step 3]]

:: End0
This wouldn't be right as there is a source for the same claim in the body, even though the word "recently" in question appears in the introduction.
