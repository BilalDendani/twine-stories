      <h4 clear=all>Question:</h4 clear=all>
      The article <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Felli_Fel">DJ Felli Fel</a> has the word 'recently' inserted in 2008-01-05. Is it still correctly used? The context is:</br><i>radio DJ for L.A.'s Power 106, record producer, and a recording artist <b>recently</b> signed to So So Def/Island Urban Music. He is also a member of The Heavy</i></br><a target="_blank" style="float:right;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Felli_Fel">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Felli_Fel</a><iframe src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Felli_Fel" style="height: 40%; width: 100%;">[Can not display <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Felli_Fel">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DJ_Felli_Fel</a> inline as an iframe here.]</iframe>

[[**Change the word "recently" to reference the date of the event.** ->Step 1]]

[[ **Delete the word "recently" and leave the rest as it it.** ->End1]]

[[ **Click for more pronunciation evaluation.** ->PronEval]]





:: Step 1
When trying to find the correct date, what will you do?

[[ **Use my memory of the event for the date it occurred.** ->End 2]]

[[ **Go through my old newspapers to find the particular event.**->End 3]]

[[ **Search for an online source that refers to the particular event. **->Step 2]]

:: End1
It's better to do a more detailed edit of the article.

[[**Go back..** ->Start]]

:: Step 2
Which online source would be the most reliable for you?
[[**An online blogger who has talked about this event in detail.**->End 4]]

[[**My online friends on Facebook give reliable information.** ->End 5]]

[[**A reputed news organizations web page.** ->Step 3]]


:: End 2
This is can be equated to adding an opinion without a source which violates Wikipedia's policies.

[[**Go back.. **->Step 1]]

:: End 3
The sources you use should be verifiable by others. An offline source would be difficult to verify.

[[**Go back. **->Step 1]]

:: Step 3
You are on the right track! Once you've found the information, how would you answer the question?

[[**Replace the word "recently" with the date and touch nothing else .** ->End 6]]

[[**Replace the word "recently" with the date and cite the source used.** ->Step 4]]

[[**Cite the source that can be used and let someone else replace "recently".** ->End 7]]



:: End 4
Although this is a reasonable source, it is better if the source is more reliable and has a good track record.
[[**Go back.** ->Step 2]]

:: End 5
Wikipedia articles should always be reliable, published sources. Facebook is not the way.

[[**Go back.** ->Step 2]]

:: Step 4
You have successfully added your answer and cited your sources! Now someone else will verify what you have done. If the person agrees with you then an editor will look into the changes proposed.

:: End 7
You need to add your answer so that someone else can verify what your opinion on the correct answer.

[[**Go back.** ->Step 3]]

:: End 6
Its always best to cite the sources used so that someone else can verify what you've edited more easily.

[[**Go back.** ->Step 3]]

:: End0
This wouldn't be right as there is a source for the same claim in the body, even though the word "recently" in question appears in the introduction.
