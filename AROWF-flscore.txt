[[**First read up about Flesch-Kincaid readability score.** ->Step 1]]

[[**Delete a paragraph so that it becomes more readable.** ->End1]]

[[**Rewrite a paragraph but it make it more detailed.** ->End0]]

:: Step 1
This is the correct step. href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flesch%E2%80%93Kincaid_readability_tests#Flesch_reading_ease">Flesch-Kincaid readability score</a>

After reading through the article, what will your next step be?

[[**I will rewrite the article by making it less wordy.** ->Step 2]]

[[**I will add more words so that it is more easily understandable.** ->End 2]]

[[**Delete a paragraph to increase the Flesch-Kincaid readability score.** ->End 3]]


:: End1
This could delete valuable information in the article.

[[**Go back.** ->Start]]

:: End0
Without knowing exactly what Flesch-Kincaid readability score is, you might not imporve the article.

[[**Go back.** ->Start]]

:: Step 2
How would you go go about rewriting the article?

[[**Replace difficult words with smaller synonyms.** ->Step 3]]

[[**Take a simple paragraph and try to make it more comprehensive with bigger words.** ->End 4]]

[[**Remove words which seem too difficult from all the sentences.** ->End 5]]

:: End 2
Adding more words would just make the article ven more wordy than it already is.

[[**Go back.**->Step 1]]

:: End 3
While deleting a paragraph would help, it would be better that it is rewritten so that information is not lost.

[[**Go back.** ->Step 1]]

:: Step 3
 What should be the Flesch-Kincaid score that you should be aiming for after you have finished editing.

 [[**Varies depending on the article.** ->Step 4]]

 [[**Decrease by 20 always.** ->End 6]]

 [[**Increase by 20 always.** ->End 7]]

:: End 4
Adding larger words would just make the article more difficult to read.

[[**Go back.** ->Step 2]]

:: End 5
Replacing a word with its more easily understandable synonym is a better path.

[[**Go back.** ->Step 2]]

:: Step 4
This is correct. You should be careful not to lose too many details while increasing the readability.

:: End 6
This is ideal although you should be careful of making an article, like something related to science, not detailed enough.

[[**Go back.** ->Step 3]]

:: End 7
You should never try to increase the readability score.

[[**Go back.** ->Step 3]]
